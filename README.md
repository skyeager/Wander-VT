### **_*Description*_**

#### Wander VT is a full-stack application that aims to serve the active outdoor community of Vermont. This web application provides information on the best hikes around--from the highest peaks to casual wooded walks. This information includes an image of the hike, elevation, difficulty, and distance. This application also provides site visitors the ability to post when they've completed one of the listed hikes. Not only can site visitors access hike information, they can make a post about a hike, update a post, and even delete posts. This will be completed without user profiles or user authentication. Wander VT implements front-end and back-end programming languages and technologies to provide hikers of Vermont more information on Vermont's trails all while allowing site visitors to document and provide feedback on listed hikes.
